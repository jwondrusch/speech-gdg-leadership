# Clearly Define Values & Outcomes

Note:
- Two things that will have massive impact: values & outcomes.
- Outcomes drive what you do.
- Values dictate how you do it.

# Advocate & Communicate

Note:
- Every worthy cause needs a champion.
- Be the broken record.
- Communicate with the audience in mind.

---

# Evolve

Note:
- Your first idea is wrong. It becomes more right over time.
- Collaborate and compromise, then commit.
- Finish lines move.
- Work with the information you have available.
