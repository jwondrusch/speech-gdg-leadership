## According to Google

Note:

# You Have to <u>Care</u>

Note:

- Helps if the vision is meaningful.

- Have you ever wanted to follow someone that was meh?
- Excellence is often a byproduct of caring and taking responsibility.

# Leadership is Influence

Note:
- If you focus only on control, your reach will be limited.
- If you focus only on concerns, your impact will be limited.
- Influence is the bread and butter of a leader.

# Lead Yourself

Note:
- All of the topics that
- Pro-active (focus on what you can control and influence)
- Reactive (focus on what you can't influence or control.)
