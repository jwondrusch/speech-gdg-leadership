Note:
- Caring is the table stakes for leadership.
- If you don't care, you can't lead.
- It's good to care about goals, better to care about people.

# 1. People First

Note:
- Everything we do, even in software, is for people.
- Every person is different.  If you want to lead them, you have to understand them.
- Being right is often less important than the other person knowing that they've been understood.
- Positive over negative interactions.

# 2. Listen

Note:
- Leading is not shouting at people and expecting that they do what you want.
- The goal of listening is understanding.
- Speak the same language, use the same meaning.

# 3. Do the Hard Things

Note:
- Lean into challenging situations. Builds trust and confidence.
- Ask for help. You are less important than the outcome.
