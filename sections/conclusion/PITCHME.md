# In Conclusion...

# Leadership is for Everyone

Note:
- Not the only ways to lead.
- If you're very strong in one, but not all areas, that is it's own form of leadership.

# Always Be Learning

Note:
- You cannot continue to lead if you do not continue to learn.
- Learn about people, your team, your project, your industry.

# Caring, Vision, and Excellence

Note:
- Caring is the first step.
- Vision is the road map.
- Excellence earns respect.
- All of this, to empower people to work towards a shared goal.
